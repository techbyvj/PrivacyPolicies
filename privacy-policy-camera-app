Privacy Policy for Camera App

Last updated: May 15, 2024

Vijay Krishna ("I," "me," or "my") operates the Camera mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use the App and the choices you have associated with that data.

1. Information Collection and Use

The App requires access to your device's camera and microphone to provide video recording functionality. I also need access to your device's media storage to save recorded videos and access your existing media files. The App may collect the following information:

- Camera and microphone data during video recording
- Media storage access for saving and retrieving videos
- Device information for app functionality and error reporting

I use this information solely for the purpose of providing and improving the App's functionality. I do not share or sell your personal information to third parties.

2. Data Storage

Videos recorded using the App are stored locally on your device. I do not upload or store your videos on any servers.

3. Permissions

The App requires the following permissions:

- Camera: To capture video
- Microphone: To record audio with video
- Media storage access: To save and access videos on your device

You can revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings, but this may impact the App's functionality.

4. Third-party Services

The App does not use any third-party services that collect information used to identify you.

5. Security

I value your trust in providing your personal information, thus I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
